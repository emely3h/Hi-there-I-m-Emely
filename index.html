      <h3>Hey there!</h3>
      <p> My name is emely and I am a code student based in berlin. Code is a new type of university where we learn project based and CuriOsity DrivEn to become software developers.
        My first touchpoint with the world of It was back in 2020 when I started to study business informatics in Mannheim. As soon as I got in touch with the world of programming I was hooked.
        I learned a lot about java development, data structures algorithms and a little bit of software architecture and realized that becoming a software developer is my dream.
        But the software developing skills thaught at the study program are quite limited and I realized that most of my knowledge was build in little personal projects outside 
        of university. Therefore I decided to switch to the code university where the focus is on software engineering and project based learning.
      </p>
      <p>While studying business informatics I thaught myself the basics of web development and got my first job as a springboot developer at the university. 
        In a team of students and professors I helped buildung a university intern <a href"https://ctt.hs-mannheim.de/">corona tracking tool</a>.
      </p>
      <p> Still, my knowledge is very basic but I can definitely say that this is something I am very
        passionate about. Therefore, I would be very excited to get the chance to work in a team, learn from more
        experienced programmer, develop my skills further and contribute to a real project and most important generate
        real value.
        I am a curiosity driven learner, eager to grow and learn in a team.
