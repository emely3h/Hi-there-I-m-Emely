      <h3>Hey there!</h3>
      <p> My name is Emely and I really enjoy coding. In the spring 2020 I started my Business Informatics studies at
        the
        university of applied science in Mannheim. As soon as I got in touch with the world of programming I was hooked.
        In the first semester I learned the basics of Java. Now I am in the second semester and besides digging deeper
        into Java we also learn the basics of Software Architecture.</p>
      <p> As I really enjoy coding I got into a little app
        project with a few more experienced developers. Therefore, I gained some experience with flutter.
        When I lost my
        part-time job at the climbing gym due to corona I suddenly had more time. So I started learning the basics of
        web development.
      <p> Still, my knowledge is very basic but I can definitely say that this is something I am very
        passionate about. Therefore, I would be very excited to get the chance to work in a team, learn from more
        experienced programmer, develop my skills further and contribute to a real project and most important generate
        real value.
        I am a very curiosity driven, learner. If I am excited about something I love to spend hours an really get
        into
        it.</p>
